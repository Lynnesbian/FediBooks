**What would you like FediBooks to do?**
Type in your feature idea here. Please do not suggest any of the following features:
- Different bot types (for example, bots that post images)
- Donation bonuses

Please ensure that your idea is:
- Easy to understand for the end user - Don't overwhelm the user with too many options or settings, or complex terminology.
- Relatively achievable - FediBooks is a passion project developed by one person. Something like a mobile app for accessing FediBooks is beyond my skillset and would take too much time.
- Not too heavy on the server - The main FediBooks instance (https://fedibooks.com) is running on a moderately powerful server capable of relatively complex tasks, but some things such as machine learning or automated video generation are beyond its capabilities.
